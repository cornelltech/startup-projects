# Startup Projects

Startup Projects are designed to provide students replicable lessons of founderism and foster lifelong, serial entrepreneurial behavior.

Students become technical co-founders who embark on a natural startup experience that includes debating the prospects of new products and  nascent markets, recruiting co-founders, incorporating companies, engaging advisors and customers, crafting and articulating a compelling startup story, confronting ambiguity, making tough decisions, receiving critical feedback, and using technical expertise to rapidly prototype new products. Traditional classes are replaced by team meetings, appointments with experts, and hack days: in each setting students execute on what has been learned from Cornell Tech courses. Startup Projects are self-directed experiences that are executed over the course of a semester and consist of three phases: Envisioning, Teaming, and Building.

## Phase 1: Envisioning

The first phase is dedicated to empowering students to view the world through an entrepreneurial lens. Students collectively evaluate many new product ideas and nascent markets. The group is inspired by industry experts and venture capitalists, who join the students in discussion to challenge students' views and initial startup ideas. The process of envisioning new products is introspective and collaborative, giving students an organized platform to think critically about how breakthrough startups are formed.

## Phase 2: Teaming

Through group discussions, students learn about each other’s shared passions, product interests, and complementary skillsets, and self-organize into teams. Based on the product interest of each team, Cornell Tech assigns a faculty advisor to the team and helps connect those teams to relevant experts, customers, and organizations. 

## Phase 3: Building

The third phase focuses on hands-on startup experiences. Each team incorporates a real startup, implements standard operating procedures, executes against milestones in a self-directed and iterative environment, and is supported by an advisory board that provides expert advice and mentorship. The advisory board consists of an assigned Cornell Tech faculty advisor and legal counsel, and external advisors recruited by the team, including, for example industry experts, designers, investors, and developers.

Key milestones include building a “pretotype” for the purpose of understanding product usage and customer value, and building a functioning prototype for the purpose of testing technical feasibility. To accelerate progress, students participate in monthly hack days and weekly studio sessions. The culmination of the experience is a presentation to prospective stakeholders and the Cornell Tech community during Open Studio.

## Broader Goals

Students complete Startup Projects as co-founders with contacts that include experts, designers, VCs, and lawyers. As a result, students expand their career opportunities to include a direct path to entrepreneurship&mdash;either by continuing to build their startup or by replicating the actions performed during the semester toward a new venture.

Cornell Tech and other organizations also benefit from Startup Projects. The student teams’ exploratory and entrepreneurial actions contribute to public knowledge about what is required to pursue startups in the product areas focused on by the teams. Additionally, the design of Startup Projects provides Cornell Tech with a predictable way to keep the campus connected to cutting edge trends and technology.
